The Mango Leaf Diseases Detection Software is an innovative project designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying and diagnosing diseases affecting mango leaves. Mango, being a crucial fruit crop, is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and appropriate management of these diseases are vital for ensuring healthy  and maximizing production.

This software leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze images of mango leaves and provide insights into potential diseases present. By simply uploading an image of a mango leaf, the software using the CNN architecture  automatically identifies the disease (if any) and offers relevant information, including the disease's name and it's health status.
